# Boyce-Threshold-Quantile-Regression
This repository contains the data and codes for all the analyses performed in the paper 'A new threshold selection method for species distribution models with presence-only data: Extracting the mutation point of the P/E curve by threshold regression.'
# Folder description
**· RDS**: This folder contains presence-abence map generated by 'virtualspecies' package.

**. TrainData**: This folder contains traindata for building SDMs.

**. validation_points**: This folder contains validation points for threshold estimation. 

**· PandaData**: This folder Includes 910 presence records and the suitable habitat map of giant pandas.
The dataset is organized into two files:
*'Panda_Presence_data.xls' the presence records of giant pandas. the location of presence data is represented by latitude and longitude.
*'Suitable_habitat.tif' the suitable habitat map of giant pandas, where Areas assigned a value of 1 are suitable habitats.
